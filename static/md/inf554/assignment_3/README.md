<h3>Assignment</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Find 2 different infographics on the same subject and compare them using the visualization wheel.</li>
    <li>What do they do well, what do they do poorly?</li>
    <li>Suggest improvements for things they do poorly</li>
    <li>Document in HTML</li>
</ul>

<h3>Approach</h3>
<p>A Visualization Wheel was created as a SVG+XML file with Inkscape.</p>
<p>This file was copied and then modified for each infographic.</p>

<h5>Abstraction-Figuration</h5>
    <p>
        Using a chorograph makes this visualization figurative. Also, drilling down on the 
        chorogaph to counties makes this even more figurative.  The goal of the visualization is to
        show for each candidate where the individual donors are located, so figuration is
        important.

<h5>Functionality-Decoration</h5>
    <p>
        The use of head-shots of the candidates is decorative. They do not interfere with the
        comprehension.  This visualization is highly functional. Visually show the distribution of
        data as well as allowing for drilling contributes to its functionality.

<h5>Density-Lightness</h5>
    <p>This is a relative dense graph. Finding the number of donors per candidate results in a
        tremendous amount of information.
    </p>
    <p>Score 6-1</p>

<h5>Multidimensionality-Unidimentionality</h5>
    <p>
        This visualization is as multidimensional as unidimentional.  Being able to drill down to
        the county level allows the user to explore the data.  However, the data is only the number
        of donors per candidate. It does not reveal other dimensions such as the biggest donor,
        finantial status, or social association.
    </p>
    <p>Score 2-2</p>

<h5>Originality-Familiarity</h5>
    <p>
        This is a choropleth drilling down to a geospatial representation of counties.  These are
        maps that are familiar to anyone who is familiar with the geography of the United States
    </p>
    <p>Score 1-6</p>

<h5>Novelty-Redundancy</h5>
    <p>
        This visualization is neither novel nor redundant.  It is not redundant, because at the
        most granular level it only shows the data for a single county.  It is not novel, because
        it only shows donors per county per candidate.

<h5>Abstraction-Figuration</h5>
    <p>
        This visualation is highly abstract. There is no mimicry.
        It is just simple horizontal bar chart. 
    </p>
    <p>Score 6-1</p>
    
<h5>Functionality-Decoration</h5>
    <p>
        Again, head-shots of the candidates are decorations that do not interfere with the
        comprehension.  This strictly a functional visualization with bars and tooltips.
    </p>
    <p>Score 6-1</p>

<h5>Density-Lightness</h5>
    <p>
        It cannot be any lighter than this. A bar chart with aggregated number billionaire donors.
        This a dearth of information. No drill down to the actual donors and amounts.
    </p>
    <p>Score 1-6</p>

<h5>Multidimensionality-Unidimentionality</h5>
    <p>
        This is strictly a unidimential visualization.  Other than tooltips on the bars, there is
        no other affordances to the user.
    </p>
    <p>Score 1-6</p>
    
<h5>Originality-Familiarity</h5>
    <p>A bar chart is highly familiar.</p>
    <p>Score 1-6</p>

<h5>Novelty-Redundancy</h5>
    <p>
        Because this visualization is unidimentional, there is no room for novelty or redundancy.
        Novelty is missing becuase it only shows the number of donors per candidate.  It might be
        helpful to show the amounts of donationations, the biggest donors, and maybe the industry
        which is attempting to buy influence.
    </p>
    <p>Redundancy is missing because there is only a bar chart.</p>
